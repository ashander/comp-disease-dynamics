To the editors,

Please consider the enclosed letter, entitled 'Host-pathogen dynamics in fungal
diseases: Comparing SI and multi-infection models', for publication in Ecology
Letters. The manuscript consists of approximately 3500 words, five figures and a
table.

I feel this manuscript is a perfect contribution to Ecology Letters because it
provides insight into the dynamics of broad class of diseases - those caused by
fungal pathogens - that are both ecologically interesting and of conservation
concern across many taxa. I present novel theoretical results of the
interactions between age structure and repeated infections in fungal or
macroparasite diseases, which provides new interpretation of age effects of
these diseases observed in the field. I also use novel approach to comparing
transient behavior across structurally different models by matching model
behavior via dynamic criteria.

I feel that the manuscript will appeal to a diverse group of researchers
(disease and population ecologists, theoretical ecologists, conservation
biologists), while providing a useful framework for interpretation of data and
prediction in conservation of species affected by this class of disease. We hope
you consider this manuscript, and thank you for your time and consideration.
