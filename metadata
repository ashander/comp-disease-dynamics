  Emerging fungal disease pose major threats to plants and wildlife. As effects of
  many fungal diseases are load-dependent, they may be better represented by
  models with variable loads (multi-infection), rather than susceptible-infected
  (SI) models. I compare equilibrium and transient behavior between these model
  types, including the dynamics of age structure. To compare models with different
  structure, I parameterized multi-infection models to replicate SI behavior at
  either initial or equilibrium phases of an epidemic, comparing the resultant
  behavior at other phases. Multi-infection diseases have either slower initial
  growth rates of disease than SI models, or have greater population-suppressing
  effects. Multi-infection models also produce greater relative mortality in older
  host stages, and greater overall changes in population age structure, than SI
  models. These results indicate that using SI models to predict epidemic behavior
  when diseases are load-dependent may underestimate long-term effects.
