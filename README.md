# Comparative dynamics of *SI* and multi-infection disease models.

This is a repository of the code for a draft paper, "Host-pathogen dynamics in fungal diseases: Comparing SI and multi-infection models"

The file as an HTML, go [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/noamross/comp-disease-dynamics/blob/master/inst/2014-12-18-manuscript.html). A PDF is [here](https://github.com/noamross/comp-disease-dynamics/blob/master/inst/2014-12-18-manuscript.pdf?raw=true). 

The raw uncompiled paper is found in `inst/2014-12-18-manuscript.Rmd`. Using `rmarkdown::render()` on this
file will run all code for the paper, generate figures, and compile the paper as
a PDF or HTML file, (already generated in the `inst` directory).

Code run in the paper is stored externally in `comparative_simulations.R`.  Functions
are found in the `R/` directory.
