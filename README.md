Comparative dynamics of *SI* and multi-infection disease models.
================================================================

This is a repository of the code for a draft paper, "Host-pathogen dynamics in
fungal diseases: Comparing SI and multi-infection models"

To view the paper as HTML, go
[here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/noamross/comp-disease-dynamics/blob/master/inst/2014-12-18-manuscript.html).
A PDF is
[here](https://github.com/noamross/comp-disease-dynamics/blob/master/inst/2014-12-18-manuscript.pdf?raw=true).

The raw uncompiled paper is an R Markdown file,  found in `inst/2014-12-18-manuscript.Rmd`. Using
`rmarkdown::render()` on this file will run all code for the paper, generate
figures, and compile the paper as a PDF or HTML file, (already generated in the
`inst` directory).

Code run in the paper is stored externally in `inst/comparative_simulations.R`, with
parameters set in `inst/base_parms.R`.
Functions are found in the `R/` directory.

Feedback is more than welcome in whatever form you want, including
[email](mailto:noam.ross@gmail.com), and [Github
issues](https://github.com/noamross/comp-disease-dynamics/issues/new), and pull
requests. Any contributions will be awknowledged. Contact me first if you want
to contribute something big enough to be considered co-authorship.
