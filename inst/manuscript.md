Abstract
========

Age structure in a model with repeated infections violates standard assumptions
of disease distribution, changing disease dynamics. When disease and demographic
time scales are similar, the formation of disease "cohorts" can lead to
multi-modal distributions of infections.

Introduction
============

-   Review of age structure in disease model (limited, as this is large)
    -   Recent Caswell paper on matrix models

-   Review of multiple-infection literature (less limited)
-   Review of overlap of the two (only a couple of papers)

-   Diseases modeled as SI for which multiple infection may be appropriate.
    - Sudden Oak Death
    - What else?
    
## Models

-   A version of @Anderson1978 ODEs with age structure
-   An infinite set of ODEs with age structure
-   An equivalent stochastic poisson-process based model with multiple
    infections and age structure
    
## Results

-   Analytics: Show how the @Anderson1978 deviates from the infinite set of
    equations when there is age structure
-   Numerical results: Show the multi-modality of infection distribution
-   Show how how looking at data as only SI would result in mis-characterization
    of relative parameters of age classes
-   Compare each ODE model with outputs of stochastic model. How do each compare
    to steady-state and transient conditions?

## Discussion

-   Underlying assumptions of infection/parasite distribution break down in the
    face of other population structure
-   Disease structure can reflect underlying pop structure
-   What diseases should be represented with multiple infections? What disease
    have age-related patterns that may be due to repreated infections?
