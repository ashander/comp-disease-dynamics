		  host-parasite associations are discussed. (2) The models
		  contain the central assumption that the parasite increases
		  the rate of host mortalities. The parasite induced changes
		  in this rate are formulated as functions of the parasite
		  numbers per host and hence of the statistical distribution
		  of the parasites within the host population. (3) The
		  parameters influencing the ability of the parasite to
		  regulate the growth of its host's population, and the

		  each model. (4) Three specific categories of population
		  processes are shown to be of particular significance in
		  stabilizing the dynamical behaviour of host-parasite
		  interactions and enhancing the regulatory role of the
		  parasite. These categories are overdispersion of parasite
		  numbers per host, nonlinear functional relationships

  abstract	= {Chytridiomycosis, the disease caused by the chytrid
		  fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has
		  contributed to amphibian population declines and
		  extinctions worldwide. The impact of this pathogen,
		  however, varies markedly among amphibian species and
		  populations. Following invasion into some areas of
		  California's Sierra Nevada, Bd leads to rapid declines and
		  local extinctions of frog populations (Rana muscosa, R.
		  sierrae). In other areas, infected populations of the same
		  frog species have declined but persisted at low host
		  densities for many years. We present results of a 5-year
		  study showing that infected adult frogs in persistent
		  populations have low fungal loads, are surviving between
		  years, and frequently lose and regain the infection. Here
		  we put forward the hypothesis that fungal load dynamics can
		  explain the different population-level outcomes of Bd
		  observed in different areas of the Sierra Nevada and
		  possibly throughout the world. We develop a model that
		  incorporates the biological details of the Bd-host
		  interaction. Importantly, model results suggest that host
		  persistence versus extinction does not require differences
		  in host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, or
		  environmental conditions, and may be just epidemic and
		  endemic population dynamics of the same host-pathogen
		  system. The different disease outcomes seen in natural
		  populations may result solely from density-dependent
		  host-pathogen dynamics. The model also shows that
		  persistence of Bd is enhanced by the long-lived tadpole
		  stage that characterize these two frog species, and by
		  nonhost Bd reservoirs.},

		  paradox. In recent years studies with amoeba, slime molds,

		  restructured forest ecosystems at large spatial scales over
		  the past 100 years. These events threaten biodiversity
		  associated with impacted host trees and other resources
		  valued by human societies even when they do not directly
		  cause host extinction. 2. Invasion of Phytophthora ramorum
		  and emergence of the forest disease sudden oak death has
		  caused a large-scale decline of tanoak (Notholithocarpus
		  densiflorus) in Californian coastal forests. Here, we
		  describe structural changes to tanoak forests and develop
		  predictive models of infection rates, mortality rates and
		  changes in tanoak biomass and abundance by combining
		  regionally extensive longitudinal field studies and
		  mathematical modelling. 3. Pathogen-invaded stands had
		  smaller average tanoak tree size and higher proportions of
		  large dead tanoak trees compared with uninvaded stands.
		  This pattern is caused in part by a positive relationship
		  between tanoak size and mortality rate, as well as prolific
		  basal sprouting from trees killed by the disease. Tanoak
		  infection, mortality and biomass decline rates were
		  positively related to the prevalence of infection in
		  sporulation-supporting species, especially California bay
		  laurel (Umbellularia californica). 4. We developed a
		  stage-structured and spatially explicit mathematical model
		  including species dynamics and P. ramorum transmission,
		  where the long-term outcome of disease ranges from host
		  extinction when densities of bay laurel are high to limited
		  or no disease outbreak. Low densities of tanoak in a matrix
		  of non-susceptible neighbouring species resulted in
		  slow-enough transmission to retain overstorey tanoak,
		  suggesting host-density thresholds may exist in real
		  forests. 5.Synthesis. Tanoak is likely to persist in many
		  disease-impacted forests via vegetative reproduction, but
		  overstorey trees may be eliminated or greatly reduced in
		  abundance, a pattern similar to other forest diseases that
		  have emerged in the last century including chestnut blight
		  and beech bark disease. Our results support a general model
		  of disease-caused changes to forest trees useful for the
		  analysis of emerging forest pathogens where vegetative
		  reproduction, community-level epidemiology and

		  fundamental notion to explain resource-dependent virulence
		  in a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia)-zooplankton host
		  (Daphnia) system and in a variety of other disease systems
		  with invertebrate hosts. In an experiment, well-fed hosts
		  died faster and produced more parasites than did austerely
		  fed ones. This resource-dependent variation in virulence
		  and other experimental results (involving growth and
		  reproduction rate/timing of hosts) readily emerged from a
		  model based on dynamic energy budgets. This model follows
		  energy flow through the host, from ingestion of food, to
		  internal energy storage, to allocation toward growth and
		  reproduction or to a parasite that consumes these reserves.
		  Acting as a consumer, the parasite catalyzes its own
		  extinction, persistence with an energetically compromised
		  host, or death of the host. In this last case, more
		  resources for the host inadvertently fuels faster parasite
		  growth, thereby accelerating the demise of the host
		  (although the opposite result arises with different
		  resource kinetics of the parasite). Thus, this model can
		  explain how resource supply drives variation in virulence.
		  This ecological dependence of virulence likely rivals

		  species of rodents from Slovakia (Apodemus agrarius, A.
		  flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, A. uralensis, Clethrionomys
		  glareolus, Microtus arvalis, and M. subterraneus). We
		  estimated the age of the host from its body mass and
		  expected the host age-dependent pattern of flea abundance,
		  the level of aggregation, and prevalence to be in agreement
		  with theoretical predictions. We expected that the mean
		  abundance and the level of aggregation of fleas would be
		  lowest in hosts of smallest and largest size classes and
		  highest in hosts of medium size classes, whereas pattern of
		  variation of prevalence with host age would be either
		  convex or asymptotic. In general, mean abundance and
		  species richness of fleas increased with an increase in
		  host age, although the pressure of flea parasitism in terms
		  of number of fleas per unit host body surface decreased
		  with host age. We found 2 clear patterns of the change in
		  flea aggregation and prevalence with host age. The first
		  pattern demonstrated a peak of flea aggregation and a
		  trough of flea prevalence in animals of middle age classes
		  (Apodemus species and C. glareolus). The second pattern was
		  an increase of both flea aggregation and flea prevalence
		  with host age (both Microtus species). Consequently, we did
		  not find unequivocal evidence for the main role of either
		  parasite-induced host mortality or acquired resistance in
		  host age-dependent pattern of flea parasitism. Our results
		  suggest that this pattern can be generated by various
		  processes and is strongly affected by natural history

		  may occasionally override these influences. White-nose
		  syndrome, caused by the emerging fungal pathogen
		  Pseudogymnoascus destructans, is spreading across North
		  America and threatens several bat species with extinction.
		  We examined patterns and drivers of seasonal transmission
		  of P. destructans by measuring infection prevalence and
		  pathogen loads in six bat species at 30 sites across the
		  eastern United States. Bats became transiently infected in
		  autumn, and transmission spiked in early winter when bats
		  began hibernating. Nearly all bats in six species became
		  infected by late winter when infection intensity peaked. In
		  summer, despite high contact rates and a birth pulse, most
		  bats cleared infections and prevalence dropped to zero.
		  These data suggest the dominant driver of seasonal
		  transmission dynamics was a change in host physiology,
		  specifically hibernation. Our study is the first, to the
		  best of our knowledge, to describe the seasonality of
		  transmission in this emerging wildlife disease. The timing
